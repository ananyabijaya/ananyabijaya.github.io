I am a highly motivated researcher in the field of computational mechanics, with a focus on fracture of architected materials and mutliscale mechanics. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D in the field and have a wealth of knowledge and expertise in my domain. My expertise includes developing efficient parallel user subroutines for Abaqus, writing finite element code in open source package FEniCS, using neural networks for constitutive modelling and writing python scripts for automating pre/post processing tasks. Additionally, I have 2.5 years of experience as a bridge designer; which has provided me with a strong understanding of challenges in the real-world problems. I am interested in both research projects and industry opportunities that allow me to apply my expertise in practical ways.
